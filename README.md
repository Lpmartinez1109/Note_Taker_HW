# Note_Takers

As a user,
Sometimes, it's hard to keep track of my notes on pen and paper.
Which is why with this app, users will be able to write down their notes and then save it for later uses.

The purpose of this project was to create a app that lets users type in any kind of note they want and save it to the site. The saved notes would then be displayed on the left-hand sode of the screen and can either be deleted or called back on a click. Users can also app mulitple notes if they so choose.
